    "3. Choose an appropriate GLM.\n",
    "4. Fit the GLM.\n",
    "5. Calculate the correlation between the predictios and the actual outcomes.\n",
    "6. Provide a scatter plot between actual outcomes and predictions.\n",
    "7. Pick a random MLB baseball game played in the 2017 season. Use the model to predict how many expected runs are to be scored by the home team (what is the predicted distribution?).\n",
    "8. Compare that to the actual number of rns scored by the home team. How well did the model perform?\n",
    "9. Submit work for review via a sharable link to the Colab Notebook."
